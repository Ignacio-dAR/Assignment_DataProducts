Assignment work for the Coursera class "Develop Data Product" - regarding the creation of a shinyapp.

This assignment consist on creating an app using the package "shiny" in R, and then publishing it through the webpage shinyapps.io.

In my case, I wanted to develop a quite simple app, based on a tremendously famous topic: Cosmopolitan tests. For many years I've seen friends and relatives alike read and fill these tests to finally find some weird result.

In this case, the App works in the following way:

a) Answer the questions included in the left side of the screen by chosing one of the 4 options suggested.

b) Press the "submit" button.

c) Learn about yourself by reviewing your results in the right side of the screen.

The App has a predefine set of rules to calculate which combination yields each of the possible results, and collect all data from the input variables accordingly, make the calculations and provide the resulting messages.

Every time the answers to the 3 questions are modified (and submitted) you can potentially obtain a different result.
